|----|---------------------------|
| 👋 | Hi, I’m @spopida aka Adrian Hall |
| 👀 | I’m interested in Angular, CQRS, DDD, Docker, ES6, Event Sourcing, FP, Http4k, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Kotlin, OAuth2 + OIDC, Messaging, Microservices, MongoDB, NextJS, OOP, RabbitMQ, React, REST, Spring, TypeScript, WebFlux, ... well you get the gist |
| 🌱 | I’m currently learning ... all of the above |
| 💞️ | I’m a member of the [mermaid-js](https://github.com/mermaid-js) organization, having authored the Entity-Relationship Diagram feature in 2020.  Sadly, I'm not a regular maintainer any more due to lack of time | 
| 🚧 | I'm also developing a full-stack application called GovBuddy which allows UK businesses to manage their legal entities using the latest APIs provided UK regulatory bodies |
| 🚁| I'm currently the Lead Engineer for John Lewis Financial Services (part of the John Lewis Partnership) |

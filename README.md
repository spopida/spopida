|  :droplet:  | About me             |
|----|---------------------------|
| 👋 | Hi, I’m @spopida aka Adrian Hall |
| 👀 | I’m interested in Java, Spring, OAuth2 + OIDC, MongoDB, REST, Messaging, RabbitMQ, WebFlux, ReactJS, CQRS, DDD, JSON, JavaScript, ES6, Microservices, Docker, Event Sourcing, ... well you get the gist |
| 🌱 | I’m currently learning ... all of the above |
| 💞️ | I’m a member of the [https://github.com/mermaid-js](mermaid-js) organization, having authored the Entity-Relationship Diagram feature in 2020.  I am maintaining and improving this on an ad-hoc basis | 
| 🚧 | I'm also developing a full-stack application called GovBuddy which allows UK businesses to manage their legal entities using the latest APIs provided UK regulatory bodies. This is what is keeping me busy at the moment |
| 🚁| And I do IT strategy and architecture consultancy - that's also keeping me busy |
| 💷 | And I help firms obtain tax relief from the UK tax authority (HMRC) by identifying and documenting innovative R&D projects
| 📫 | You can email me at [ade@adrian-hall.name](mailto:ade@adrian-hall.name) |
